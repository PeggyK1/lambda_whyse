## Code Review of lambda_whyse


### Positive Feedback
1. The code is clean and very easy to read.
2. I believe the functionality of the code provides a very efficent method of performing train/validation/test splits with sklearn.

### Constructive Feedback
1. PEP 8 Style Guide reccomends 2 blank lines between the levels. (Ex. under the imports and between the classes)
2. I am not sure why both classes are named "MyDataFrame". Perhaps you can explain your reasoning behind it.
